JAVA ABSTRACTION --- UNNECESSAY DATA HIDE THE DATA IMPLEMENTATION(INTERNAL FUCNTIONALITY)

ENCAPSULATION -- DATA AND METHODS COMBINING (PROVIDING SECURITY) DATA MEMNBERS AS PRIVATE

USER NOT ACCESS IN ENACAPSULATION 


SERIALIZTION IS ALSO USED FOR SECURITY ---

TRANSIENT --- CONVERT OBJECT DATA INTO BYTECODE THROUGH  -- serialization

stirctFp --- at the time of floating point calcultaion

volatile -- get the data from main memory not from thread cache





NATIVE -- WITHDRAW METHOD -- IF METHOD IS DIFFICULT IN JAVA 
The native keyword is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in 
native code using JNI (Java Native Interface). native is a modifier applicable only for methods
and we can't apply it anywhere else. The methods which are implemented in C, C++ are called as 
native methods or foreign methods --get the native code from other platforms

compile time -- method overloading -- method overriding --- 

Runtime -- dynamic method dispatch --- this method used for setter and getters


how many ways to create Objects 
-------------------------------
new keyword
constructor
static -- anywhere we can access in the class.
setters and getters method 

String --- immmutable -- it store data in heap and constent pool.

String literal 
String using new keyword

String a = "100";

a = "200";

StringBuffer -- synchronized, threadsafe -- it may be occurs deadlock.
StringBuilder -- mutable -- perform multiple operations at a time.

constructor
-----------

At the time creation of object

we can override and not able use static, final--- 

final, finally, finalize
------------------------
final --
variable-- we can't changes the final values it is used for constant
method -- it not able to use override 
class -- inheritance is not works

finalize() 
--------
it is called by GC. System.gc()

before the destroying the objects.

finally block 
-------------


Exceptions is super class of all exceptions 

Throws -- we can through the default exception
throw -- custom exceptions through by it.

Abstract class
--------------
normal members 
concrete methods
abstract methods

70 - 80 % abstraction


Interface
---------
public static final variable
public abstract methods alone

object is created by implementation class


Interface sample
{
	int a;
}

Inheritance 
-----------
Code Reusability , Code Extendability
disadvantage -- memory wastage --- 


collections 
------------
set list map
set will not 

enum {janavary,}; --- constact collection
iterator -- slow its used for legacy class as well as normal classes.

eG Enterprise is a total performance management solution that provides automated IT monitoring, 
diagnosis, and reporting to troubleshoot application slowdowns, user experience issues, network 
outages, virtualization bottlenecks, server failures, storage hotspots, and more.

eG Enterprise uses a combination of agent-based and agentless approach to monitor the health and 
performance of the entire IT infrastructure from application code to bare metal across physical, 
virtual and cloud, and hybrid IT environments – from a single pane of glass. Using a patented 
performance correlation and root cause diagnosis technology, eG Enterprise simplifies performance 
troubleshooting, resulting in faster problem resolution and increased operational efficiency for 
IT pros.



Built-In Reports and Analytics for Trending, Forecasting and Capacity Planning
==============================================================================

eG Enterprise provides personalized views for different stakeholders in your organization. 
Real-time dashboards can be created and viewed in minutes. Aggregated metrics provide 
enterprise-wide views of IT demand, quality and utilization.

eG Enterprise also offers comprehensive pre-built and custom reports. High-level IT service 
performance reports help executives identify areas that need attention. Deep-dive operations 
reports allow IT managers to zoom into the performance of specific tiers of the infrastructure. 
Trending and forecasting reports help architects identify opportunities for optimization and 
cost savings.




Universal IT Monitoring Technology
==================================
IT Monitoring - Universal Monitoring TechnologyThe eG Universal Monitor enables the unified 
IT monitoring of 180+ applications, 10+ operating systems, 10+ virtualization platforms and 
20+ storage devices. Based on embedded domain expertise, the eG Universal Monitor provides 
performance monitoring insights into end-user experience, business transactions, applications 
and the supporting infrastructure (physical, virtual and cloud). Administrators have the 
flexibility to choose between agent-based and agentless monitoring options.

Deployment is easy - eG Enterprise can be loaded in a gold image and configured on-the-fly to 
monitor different applications or servers.

Licensing is simple - Based on the number of servers, and not on CPU/cores, the server operating 
or even specific applications.

Automatic Baselining Through Machine Learning
=============================================
Setting thresholds for thousands of performance metrics is tedious, time consuming and requires 
a great deal of expertise. In many cases, the thresholds must be time-varying 
(time of day, day of week) and cannot be set manually.

eG Enterprise auto-baselines all the metrics it collects. By analyzing historical data, 
it automatically determines time-varying thresholds. Multiple levels of thresholds are supported 
to allow problem escalation. Alerts are triggered when deviations from the norm are noticed, 
so you are informed pre-emptively before problems escalate and impact user experience


Automatic Performance Correlation and Root Cause Diagnosis
==========================================================

Since IT infrastructures are very inter-dependent, a problem in one tier can ripple and affect 
all the other tiers. New inter-dependencies introduced by virtualization and cloud computing 
further accentuate the situation.

eG Enterprise embeds the industry's first truly virtualization- and cloud-aware root cause 
diagnosis technology. Discovering application-to-application, application-to-VM and VM-to-host 
and host-to-storage dependencies, eG Enterprise correlates performance alerts from different tiers 
and automatically pinpoints where the root cause of a problem lies. This way you can differentiate 
the cause of a problem from its effects and resolve performance issues in minutes rather than in days.





Improve Business Outcomes with IT Monitoring and Proactive Performance Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Application Availability
On an average, one hour of downtime costs businesses $474,000 in lost revenue. 
eG Enterprise helps you to monitor, pre-emptively detect and quickly resolve application issues. 
This way, you can prevent downtime and ensure great performance and user satisfaction and save 
your business tons of money.

 Migration
When application infrastructures are migrated, user experience is key. IT performance management 
& proactive monitoring helps you benchmark performance before and after migration. Comparing key 
metrics, you can identify problems introduced during migration and fix them quickly as they arise.

 Cost Reduction
Many a times, hardware is added indiscreetly in a bid to solve performance problems. 
This results in cost overruns and stalls IT transformation initiatives. eG Enterprise helps you 
identify bottlenecks, maximize resource utilization and reduce hardware and software costs and 
to right-size your IT infrastructure.

 Scaling Rollouts
IT managers are looking for ways to scale their infrastructure – to support more users, 
new workloads, etc. eG Enterprise’s historical reporting and predictive analytics help identify 
bottlenecks in the infrastructure. Thus, you can determine where to make investments to allow the 
infrastructure to scale.

 Operational Efficiency
By making it possible to diagnose problems with one click, eG Enterprise empowers helpdesk personnel 
to manage and troubleshoot performance issues. This way, organizations can significantly reduce their 
IT operations costs.

 Compliance Tracking
Track user logins, access durations and application usage for compliance reporting. Alert on 
exceptions for immediate remediation. Detect and report history of configuration changes and 
cross-correlate with performance degradations.

 Performance Optimization
As IT infrastructures become software-defined, adding more hardware only alleviates performance 
problems temporarily. With visibility into the performance of every layer, every tier of the 
infrastructure, you can determine how to optimally utilize the current infrastructure investments 
to do more.

 Release Preparedness
Prior to release, get the diagnostics and actionable intelligence you need to eliminate any 
bottleneck areas. Immediately after deployment, get the deep visibility and insights you need 
to troubleshoot and resolve new issues quickly.
