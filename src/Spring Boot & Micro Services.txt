Spring Booot & Micro Services

Spring Framework
----------------

Spring Container :

1. Scan your Classes (Spring Bean)
2. Create object to them
3. Provide data to variables
4. Link one Object with another object
5. Finally (while Stopping) Destroy the objects and Container.

1. Scan 
2. Object
3. Data
4. Link
5. Destroy

Example  
-------
1. Spring Bean
package com.nit.sarath
public class MyDBConnection {
 private String driver;
 private String url;
 private String un;
 private String pwd;
 //setters and getters.. toString()...
}
2. Spring Config (XML Configuration)

<bean class = "com.nit.sarath" id ="com">
  <property name="driver" value="OracleDriver"/>
  <property name="url" value="jdbc:oracle..."/>
  <property name="un" value="nit"/>
  <property name="pwd" value="sarath"/>
</bean>

--> <bean> it indicates to container 'create object'
--> <property> it indicates to container ' provide Data'

Spring Boot
===========
Spring Boot is a Framework created using Spring F/W only.
It behaves like Parent Project to our project (Child Project)
that provides commons code.
EX:
Database Connection
Curd Operation
Security
Transaction Management
Email Alert
Scheduled Task.. etc

Above common things are handled by Spring Boot Parent Project. So, work reduced to programmer.

Auto-configuration
------------------
Providing common setup for a task/module in application that gives common classes, config files,
JARS,servers, Database and plugins...etc.


In Spring we need to write configuration and need to implement/add JARS.

In Spring Boot just add  spring-boot-starter-jdbc (Maven/Gradle) we should add inside your child project.

Then All required setup for JDBC is given by Parent Project to your project.


Q) What is starter? Spring-boot-starter-________
A) It is a JAR file that contains ready made code which is common for every project.

Ex:
   Spring-boot-starter-jdbc , will do by spring boot
   Database Connection
   Connection Pooling
   Enable Support For Tx Management
