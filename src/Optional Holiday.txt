Hi Sir, Good Morning,

Tomorrow i.e., 13/04/2021 ( The Festival of Telugu Ugadi ) is an Optional Holiday. So, I would like to make a request for the holiday. Could you please consider my request and grant me to take holiday.

Thanks & Regards
Sarat Kumar Sajja

SELECT ename,sal from Employee e1 where 
        N-1 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sal)from Employee e2 where e2.sal > e1.sal) 


select min(sal) from (select distinct sal from emp order by sal desc)  where rownum = 4

select * from (select name,sal,dense_rank() over(order by sal desc) rank from emp ) where rank = number;

Number is 3rd == 3
